M2 Analysis
===========

1. [Introduction](introduction.md)
2. Data - We use the Nature 2021 data release
3. Method - We use the background model from the 2vbb analysis to model the background in the M2 data and look for evidence of 0vbb decay on top of it.
4. Fit Optimization
    - Component Selection
    - Rotation
    - Smoothing
    - 0vbb Cutoff
    - Co spectra shift
