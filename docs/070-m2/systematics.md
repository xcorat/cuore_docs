Systematic Uncertainties
========================

#### Background model systematics
To evaluate the effect of uncertainties related to background model predictions, we run the fit multiple times while varying the input components according to the JAGS fit output. We pick a random point from the JAGS Markov Chain (instead of the mode as above) and use those normalization factors to create input component PDFs.
