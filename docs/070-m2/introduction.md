Introduction
============

1. In this section we explain the [0vbb] search in the CUORE detector array using our Multiplicity 2 data.
2. While our main analysis focuses on events where the full [decay energy][Qbb] is deposited in a single crystal, we expect ~12% of the [0vbb] events to deposit their energy in at least two crystals (or more), a third of which we expect to deposit most of their [decay energy][Qbb] in two crystals [Multiplicity 2 events][M2]
3. Our goal in this analysis, thus, is to obtain a (bayesian posterior) probability distribution of the [0vbb] rate(or $T_{1/2}$) by modeling the observed 2D M2 spectrum as a sum of expected decay spectra which includes the [0vbb] signal and multiple background components as modeled in the [Background Model][BM] while marginalizing over the strength (number of events) of each component.



[0vbb]: $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay

[Qbb]: $Q_{\beta\beta}$

[M2]: Multiplicity 2

[BM](../060-bm/index.md): Background Model
